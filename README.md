# 👋 Greetings! I'm Albert Saman

## **Electronics Engineer | Embedded Systems Developer | Circuit Designer**

Welcome to my corner of the hardware world! I am an aspiring Electronics Engineering student at Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT) focused on bridging the gap between digital code and physical reality. My passion lies in designing robust, efficient, and reliable systems, from schematic capture to firmware deployment.

### Get to know me 
- 👀 I’m interested in travelling the world and experiencing new cultures through meeting new people.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think outside the "outside the box". Boxes are just suggestions anyway :)
